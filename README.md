# EPISTEMIC INSIGHTS

**Critical Analysis of AI & Knowledge Trust**

A research newsletter examining how artificial intelligence systems disrupt epistemic trust through the counterfeiting of legitimacy signals, not primarily through inaccuracy.

## About This Newsletter

This newsletter presents findings from ongoing research into how AI systems disrupt the social architecture of knowledge validation. Rather than focusing on accuracy problems (hallucinations, biases, errors), this work examines how AI disrupts the *mechanisms* through which societies distinguish legitimate knowledge from mere assertion.

### Key Concepts

**Authority Laundering:** When users interpret AI's aggregation of training data as representing expert consensus, mistaking computational synthesis for collective validation.

**Legitimacy Signal Counterfeiting:** The reproduction of credibility markers (citations, formal language, institutional formatting) at near-zero cost while verification costs remain high.

**The Three Pillars Framework:**
- **Provenance:** Traceability to accountable sources
- **Verification:** Independent assessment through transparent methodology
- **Accountability:** Identifiable agents bear consequences for errors

## Current Issue

**Vol. 1 - January 2026**

### Featured Topics:
- The Authority Laundering Problem
- How AI outputs appear expert without earning trust
- The three-stage process of legitimacy counterfeiting
- Real-world case: Fabricated legal citations
- The verification crisis
- Implications for researchers, educators, and organizations

## About the Research

This newsletter is based on forthcoming research:

**"Counterfeit Authority: How AI Disrupts Trust, Credibility, and the Legitimacy of Knowledge"**  
*by Bryanna Mischewski*

The work draws on sociology of knowledge, science and technology studies, and information ethics to examine epistemic legitimacy in knowledge-producing institutions.

### Research Focus Areas:
- Academic research integrity
- Medical knowledge validation
- Journalistic credibility
- Public governance and policy documentation
